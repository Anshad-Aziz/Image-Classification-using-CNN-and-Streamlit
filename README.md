Image Classification using CNN and Streamlit
Overview
This project demonstrates a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the deployment is done using a Streamlit web application. Users can upload an image to classify it into one of the predefined categories.

Features
A simple CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
Training on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Deployment as an interactive Streamlit web app.
User-friendly interface for uploading and classifying images.
Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
For more details, visit the CIFAR-10 dataset page.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Streamlit
NumPy
OpenCV (for image processing)
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-cnn.git
cd image-classification-cnn
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the Model (Optional)
The model is pre-trained and saved as cnn_model.h5. If you'd like to retrain:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
4. Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
5. Upload an Image
Open the app in your browser.
Upload an image to classify it.
